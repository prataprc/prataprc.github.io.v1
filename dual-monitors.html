  <div  class="content"> <p>For programming purpose, I find that square monitors are more impressive than
the wide-screen, but they are slightly costlier than the equivalent widescreen
monitors. If you are buying both the monitors at the same time, then it is
easy to buy the same model. But if you are adding another monitor to the
current one. Then stick with same specification, like 17&quot; 1280x1024
resolution.</p>
<p>Normally Graphics card come with DVI output, forcing you to buy monitors
with DVI connectivity. Since we are buying for programming purpose, it is
better to stick with VGA (thus saving some money) and buy a DVI-VGA adaptor.
But if you are a multimedia geek, then you might want to use DVI monitors.</p>
<div class="section" id="graphics-card">
<h1>Graphics Card</h1>
<p>If the purpose of the Video Card is only to provide dual monitor support then,
I would suggest a basic model from Nvidia, 8400 GS. But these days Nvidia is
promoting lots of high perfromance computing on it GPU and being a programmer
it is only natural to buy one which supports CUDA. In any case, the driver
support from Nvidia is amazing. And that brings us to installing the driver
for our new Graphics Card.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux-drivers">
<h1>Linux Drivers</h1>
<p>Drivers can be installed via the distributions package manager, like for
debian, <cite>nvidia-glx</cite> or <cite>nvidia-glx-new</cite> can be installed
or the drivers can be installed from
<a class="reference external" href="http://nvidia.com/page/drivers.html">Nvidia Site</a>.
Download the appropriate driver installation file, (which normally ends with
'.run') and execute them</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo sh &lt;nvidia-driver-installation-file&gt;.run
</pre></div>
<p>Follow the instruction and install the driver. Restart the system. And you
will find that when X server is loaded NVIDIA splash screen will be displayed.</p>
<p>But before that you will need to resolve the 'primary graphics card' in your
BIOS settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bios-setting">
<h1>BIOS setting</h1>
<p>Verify with your BIOS manual (motherboard vendor manual) to configure Primary
Graphics Card. Normally the configuration will be similar to the configuration
for Primary Boot Device.</p>
<p>Once the Primary Graphics Card configuration is done successfully, you will
be able to see the Graphics Card's BIOS splash as the first screen while
system booting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enabling-dual-monitors">
<h1>Enabling Dual monitors</h1>
<p>After rebooting and logging in, goto,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
system -&gt; Nvidia X Server Setting
</pre>
<p>and configure for dual monitor by Enabling <cite>TwinView</cite> in 'X server Display
configuration'</p>
