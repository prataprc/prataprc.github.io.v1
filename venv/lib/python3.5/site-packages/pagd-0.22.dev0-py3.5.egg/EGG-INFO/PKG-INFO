Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Static web site generator, based on well understood MVC_ - Model, View,
        Controller - design philosophy. The general idea behind MVC from web
        application's perspective is
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
                                              +--------+
                                              |template|
                                              +--------+
                                                  |
                                                  V   
                   +-------+   +----------+    +------+    +-----+
                   |request|-->|controller|--->|action|<---|model|
                   +-------+   +----------+    +------+    +-----+
                                                  |
                                                  V
                                             +---------+
                                             |HTML page|
                                             +---------+
                                                  |
                                                  V
                        goes to the client  +-------------+
                      <---------------------|http-response|
                                            +-------------+
        
        
        The general idea being that,
        
        - http request reaches web-application's controller logic.
        - controller resolves request to web-action by parsing request-URL.
        - the action-logic gathers necessary context information from database models
          and other sources.
        - a html-template is identified, and the final HTML page is generated using
          context information from models and page-layout from one or more template
          files.
        
        ``pagd`` follows, more or less, a similar principle to build a web-site from a
        collection of files organised as a directory tree. Here is a brief idea on how
        it is done
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
        
               +------+    +---------+      +-------------+
               |layout|--->|generator|<---->|page-iterator| 
               +------+    +---------+      +-------------+
                                |                  ^
                                |                  |          +------------+
                                V                  +<---------|page-context|
                           +---------+             |          +------------+
                           |Html-page|             |       
                           +---------+             |          +-------------+
                                |                  +<---------|page-template|
                                |                  |          +-------------+
                                V            +------------+
                           +--------+        |page-content|
                           |web-site|        +------------+
                           +--------+      
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - generates static output, hence can be hosted anywhere.
        - pluggable layouts.
        
          - I am currently using `pagd.myblog` layout for publishing my blog articles.
          - It is possible to create any number of layout either as part of `pagd`
            tool or as separate package.
          - although layouts are encouraged to follow the Model-View-Controller
            concept explained above, it is up to the layout-plugin to define a structure
            and meaning of layout's source directory-tree.
        
        - everything that needs to get done by pagd is done through ``pagd`` command
          line interface.
        - command line interface comes with simple sub-commands like,
        
          - `create`, to create a new layout.
          - `gen`, to generate static web site from a source layout.
        
        - sub-commands are plugins and can be extended by implementing
          pagd.interfaces.ICommand interface.
        - to use pagd as python library, refer to ``script.py`` module under pagd
          package.
        - web-site templates can be designed using `tayra template`_.
        
          - experimental feature is available for mako and jinja2. If you face problems
            with these templates, kindly let me know.
        
        - reStructuredText directives,
          
          - code syntax highlighting.
          - play youtube video within page content.
          - display collection of images as gallery, uses magnific-popup_ jquery
            plugin. Magnific-popop is a well documented jquery plugin, it is possible
            to change its CSS file and/or pagd template script to customize it in 
            many ways.
          - to embed github gist, entire gist or individual file in a gist.
        
        - ``pagd.myblog`` layout is loaded with batteries.

            even as tayra-templates.

          - add context to individual pages are all pages under a sub-directory
            through one or more JSON files.

            disqus' server.
          - integration with git, mercurial repository to gather file's meta-data like

        pagd is under development - you can hack the code, contribute back with
        `github <https://github.com/prataprc/pagd>`_. Note that the original
        repository is maintained with mercurial and uses hg-git plugin to publish it
        on github.
