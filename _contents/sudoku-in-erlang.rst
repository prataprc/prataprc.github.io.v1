For past three decades semiconductor industry promised to double the speed
of microprocessor every two years, and they did keep to their promise. Now, it
looks like they have exhausted all the available tricks and the only way to
increase computation speed is by going parallel - packing more number of cores
in the same die. But that ain't so easy, for it requires re-designing our
algorithms to run parallel. Enter concurrent programming. Erlang is one such
language that encourages concurrency.

Concurrent programming is a paradigm of writing computer programs that can
execute in parallel. Three decades of structured programming concepts
popularized by languages like C and Java have made the entire ecosystem of
computer applications optimized for sequential programming. Now, even when we
are ready to redesign our algorithms for concurrency, its implementation,
testing and deployment are making life difficult for us. The general focus on 
Erlang here is that it may save us from some of those difficulties. Let us
experiment couple of scenarios using sudoku_. There is a separate `article
<sudoku-pathological.html>`_ describing the algorithm and why it will make
sense in this context. Source code for the same can be found in
`github <https://github.com/prataprc/sudoku>`_. You can find more details on
how to use the sudoku script there, that we will using it here.

Now, let us have some fun. 

.. code-block:: bash

    # solve a single sudoku puzzle of complexity 3 (9x9) and difficulty 40%
    $ bin/sudoku -c 3 -d 40 -s 1123
    complexity:3 count:1 difficulty:40 seed:1123
    Time taken to evaluate 6329uS

Above, sudoku script generates a 9x9 puzzle, populating 40% of the slots. And it
took 6.3 milliseconds to solve the puzzle. The `-s` option provides seed
value to the random-generator - so that same set of puzzles will be generated
for the same seed value. Note that the puzzle is solved using a sequential
backtracking algorithm explained above.

`All measurements are taken with my 2GHz Core-2 Quad desktop`.

Using the same parameters but solving 100 puzzles - `sequentially`,

.. code-block:: bash

    # solve a single sudoku puzzle of complexity 3 (9x9) and difficulty 40%
    $ bin/sudoku -c 3 -d 40 -s 1123 -n 100
    complexity:3 count:100 difficulty:40 seed:1123
    Time taken to evaluate 1182004uS

took about 1.2 seconds ! On an average, this algorithm takes about 12
milliseconds to solve a puzzle. Note that we used a pure-sequential version
of the algorithm for this measurements.

simple concurrency with erlang
------------------------------

Before we transform the algorithm into a concurrent one, we will try
to measure how simple-concurrency, like what we see with web-servers serving
simultaneous requests, fair with erlang. The objective here is to solve large
number of puzzles - first, sequentially one after the other - next,
simultaneously spawning one process for each puzzle. Thus we measure its
scalability and efficiency.

For the sake of clarity let us define the terms - sequential, parallel and
concurrent, used in this article.

sequential,
    sequential version of algorithm that uses single core, even if more than
    one core is available.
parallel,
    sequential version of algorithm used to solve more than one puzzle
    simultaneously. Although each puzzle will utilize single core, more number
    of puzzles can be solved simultaneously thus utilizing all the available
    cores.
concurrent,
    concurrent version of algorithm where each puzzle utilizes all the
    available cores.

We will run the same script with few more switches, and SMP disabled.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/sudoku -c 3 -n 100 -d 40 -s 1123 -benchmark # SMP disabled

Above command generates 100 puzzles of complexity 3, 9x9 sudoku table,
populating 40% of the slots. Same seed value will generate same set of tables.
The script outputs five columns,

* `1st column`, no. of puzzles solved.
* `2nd column` time taken to solve sequentially.
* `3rd column` time taken to solve puzzles simultaneously, one erlang-process
  for each puzzle.
* `4th column` same as 2nd column, except that concurrent version of algorithm
  is used.
* `5th column` same as 3rd column, except that concurrent version of algorithm
  is used.

`bin/sudoku` was executed in SMP disabled mode by adding the following header
in the beginning.

.. code-block:: erl

    #!/usr/bin/env escript
    %% -*- erlang -*-
    %%! -smp disable

Let us now plot the data with gnuplot_,

.. image:: media/sudokucharts/nosmp.png

Again, the script is executed with same switches but with two cores enabled.
Replace `-smp disable` with `+S 2:2` in the script header. A similar 5-column
output is generated and plotted below,

.. image:: media/sudokucharts/smp2.png

Once again, the script is executed with 4 cores enabled, that is, using
the `+S 4:4` switch and plotted below,

.. image:: media/sudokucharts/smp4.png

We can easily observe that, 

- Whether simple concurrency or concurrent-backtracking version, there is
  virtually no overhead introduced because of concurrent execution.
- Both simple concurrency and concurrent-backtracking version can linearly
  scale with number of cores.

When performance of parallel execution is plotted on single-core, 2-core, and
4-core variants,

.. image:: media/sudokucharts/par.png

we can observe that simple concurrency scales linearly with number of cores.

When performance of concurrent algorithm, executed one after another in
sequential mode, is plotted on single-core, 2-core, and 4-core variants,

.. image:: media/sudokucharts/conc.png

shows that there is no improvement of using a concurrent version of the
algorithm and neither a overhead of using it.

Let us now apply simple concurrency and concurrent backtracking algorithm for
a pathological sudoku combination and measure its performance on different
core-counts.

how does it perform for pathological cases ?
--------------------------------------------

I have added two puzzle files priv/long3.term and long4.term, both having a
pathological case.

First we will solve the pathological case with sequential version,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/sudoku -f priv/long3.term         # SMP disabled
    Time taken to evaluate: 3988177uS       # 3.9 Seconds

Then with concurrent version, on different number of cores.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP with 4 cores
    Time taken to evaluate: 195572uS        # 195 milliseconds

    $ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP with 2 cores
    Time taken to evaluate: 415335uS        # 415 milliseconds

    $ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP disabled
    Time taken to evaluate: 1078302uS       # 1 second

`-t` switch enables the concurrent mode, we can see that between 4 cores and 2
cores there is 2x improvement because the concurrent logic is making use of
the extra cores. But what will surprise us is that,

**concurrent version performs 4x better even on a single-core**. And with 4
cores, performance **improves to 20x**. How does that happen ? **welcome to
swarm algorithms !!**

swarm algorithm
---------------

A backtracking algorithm becomes a swarm algorithm when it explores as many
path as possible simultaneously, thus it avoids spending time on bad bath. In
many cases the number of steps in a backtracking algorithm is not more than
couple of hundred, and we find that, given enough execution time for the good
path it gets completed quick enough. Note that swarm algorithm does not
remove the exponential complexity of backtracking logic - but it gives a great
deal on performance.

This experiment might also teach us that concurrent programming is not just
about multiple cores.

Long ago, I wrote a similar Sudoku puzzle solver in C / Linux, but the
best part of writing it in Erlang is the way it prompted me to re-design the
algorithm for concurrency. In C, I would have never thought of spawning a
new process for every choice it makes, but here it was only natural. 

That is how a language can affect our creativity, be it for programming or for
poetry. And it is those simple and unassuming things that changes one's
perspective.
